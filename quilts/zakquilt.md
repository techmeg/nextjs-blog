This quilt represents a bit of a departure for me as the design is more or less my own, rather than a traditional pattern. My nephew, Zak, and his bride, Hannah, are both artists. When asked to send me images of designs they liked, they forwarded non-regular geometric executions that were more random than I felt capable of delivering. 

I adapted a design I had seen for a baby quilt -- long bars of color on a background, split in the center on an angle -- and enlarged and adapted it, breaking the bars at different points and making the bar sizes irregular.

When faced with the challenge of marking a quilting design, I suddenly realized how large my design execution was -- no ditch stiching would get me over the line here and something bold was needed to break up the strong horizontals of the piecing design. After rejecting  wave themes and New Orleans icons, I settled on large spirals and tucked the cute 'Zak/Mack' wedding logo the kids had made into the bottom corner, along with the wedding date.
