I made this quilt at a Log Cabin workshop at Bloom Quilts. The workshop provided a technique for more easily assembling the squares. I did it with my friend, Andrea, and it was a fun weekend. I was a bit held back by my general inability to cut accurately, but still, I like it pretty well.

I am quilting it now and the quilting is not interesting in any way. The fabric is so busy that there is no point in doing anything other than ditch-stiching. I knew there was a reason I had never made a log cabin -- I like to see my beautiful quilt stiches **(showoff!)**.
